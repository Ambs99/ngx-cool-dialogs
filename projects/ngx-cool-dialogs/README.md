# NgxCoolDialogs

This is a [fork](https://github.com/Ambs99/ngx-cool-dialogs) from ng-popups to un-rename it to ngx-cool-dialogs since it was deprecated and no source code was available.

From the original documentation:

> Easily create **alert, confirm and prompt dialogs** for Angular. Think of `window.alert` or `window.confirm`, but more angularish and way prettier.

**Based on:**
- [ng-popups](https://github.com/caroso1222/ng-popups) (go there for documentation)
- [ngx-cool-dialogs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-cool-dialogs) (original package)

## Installation

```
npm i https://github.com/Ambs99/ngx-cool-dialogs.git @angular/cdk
```

## Building

```
npm install
npm run build
```
